# fullstack-course-22
This is a repo for the first and mid-term project at the Hamburg Coding School 2022. We were given 2 weeks to complete this project.
The aim was to create a travel blog using html/css and javascript. The travel information is saved in a JSON and we were encouraged to fetch data from rest APIs. 
We were allowed to use any CSS framework and I have choosen Bulma for this project. 
For the bonus tasks, I was able to include my travel information in a Google map. I was also able to have a mini-text input field that user can remove some details which is saved in the local storage.
